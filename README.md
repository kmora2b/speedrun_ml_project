# SpeedRun ML Project

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook report (there is an additional link to access the Google Colab link), slide deck for video presentation, video presentation, and datasets used.

## Setup
Setup Jupyter from their [website](https://jupyter.org/install)

I also have a [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AzXACizd_GWLmmZ_O2BIF8-PG_H65f7-?usp=sharing) version though I recommend the local version if you have a better computer performance.

You can run the local version once you have Jupyer installed and have cloned the repo.
